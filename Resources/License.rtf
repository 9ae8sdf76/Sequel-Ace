{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Comment from iPhone Dev Wiki Crack Prevention: App Store binaries are signed by both their developer and Apple. This encrypts the binary so that decryption keys are needed in order to make the binary readable. When iOS executes the binary, the decryption keys are used to decrypt the binary into a readable state where it is then loaded into memory and executed. iOS can tell the encryption status of a binary via the cryptid structure member of LC_ENCRYPTION_INFO MachO load command. If cryptid is a non-zero value then the binary is encrypted.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \u8216'Cracking\u8217' works by letting the kernel decrypt the binary then siphoning the decrypted data into a new binary file, resigning, and repackaging. This will only work on jailbroken devices as codesignature validation has been removed. Resigning takes place because while the codesignature doesn\u8217't have to be valid thanks to the jailbreak, it does have to be in place unless you have AppSync or similar to disable codesignature checks.\par}
